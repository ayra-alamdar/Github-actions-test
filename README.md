# React Project Compilation Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to ensure that any code pushed to the repository or submitted via a pull request does not break the build process of a React application.

## Overview

The workflow automatically checks if the React project is compilable. It verifies that the project can be built successfully, ensuring code quality and preventing errors from being merged into the main branch.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger**:
   - The workflow runs automatically whenever:
     - Code is pushed to the `main` branch.
     - A pull request is created.

2. **Steps in the Workflow**:
   - **Checkout Code**: The workflow uses `actions/checkout` to clone the repository onto the GitHub-hosted runner.
   - **Set Up Node.js**: It sets up a Node.js environment compatible with the project.
   - **Install Dependencies**: The `npm install` command is executed to install all necessary project dependencies.
   - **Build the Project**: The `npm run build` command compiles the React project.
   - **Verify Build Artifacts**: The workflow checks for the existence of the `build` directory to confirm that the project compiled successfully.

3. **Validation**:
   - If the build process completes without errors and the `build` directory is found, the workflow passes.
   - If the build fails or the `build` directory is missing, the workflow fails, alerting the contributor to fix the issues before merging.

## Benefits

- Ensures code consistency and quality by catching build errors early.
- Automates the process of checking if the project is compilable.
- Saves time and effort for reviewers by pre-validating code changes.

## Usage

To use this workflow:
1. Save the provided YAML file in our repository under `.github/workflows/compile-check.yml`.
2. Push changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request to trigger the workflow.
